     * Boots the formatter workbench and eagerly resolves the ambient CLI identity, returning the ready
     * workbench.
     *
     * WHY THIS EXISTS: on boot the workbench resolves the CLI process identity (the OS user, e.g.
     * "wampuser") via the default CLI authenticator, which updates last_authenticated_on on a SINGLE
     * shared USER_AUTHENTICATOR row. That row is guarded by TimeStampingBehavior optimistic locking, so
     * when several parallel workers - all running as the same OS user - boot at the same instant, they
     * collide on that row and all but one die with a "changed in the meantime" conflict.
     *
     * WHY THE BEHAVIOR IS DISABLED FOR PARALLEL WORKERS: the optimistic-lock check that raises the
     * conflict runs inside the process performing the write, i.e. in THIS worker. Disabling the behavior
     * on the worker's own model instance therefore removes the conflict at its source, without touching
     * the stored model and without affecting any other process - the web server keeps its full locking.
     * Losing lost-update protection on the field in question is harmless: it is a last-login timestamp,
     * so "last writer wins" is exactly the semantics we want. The behavior is re-enabled immediately
     * after the identity is resolved, so the rest of the worker's run (which writes real test data) has
     * its normal guarantees back.
     *
     * WHY THE RETRY REMAINS: booting the workbench may itself touch the identity row before we get a
     * chance to disable anything. The retry stays as the backstop for that window - and it is what keeps
     * the single-process path working unchanged.
