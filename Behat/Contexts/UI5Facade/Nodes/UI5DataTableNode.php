     * targets in a single consistent index space.

     * WHY THE OUTCOME IS READ BACK: the previous version clicked and assumed success. A click
     * selects nothing in several ordinary configurations - a data cell where the widget reacts only
     * to the row selector, an editable cell that enters edit mode, a cell holding a link or button
     * that fires that instead. The failure was silent and surfaced far away as "no loaded row shows
     * this button", so working buttons were reported as skipped. Reading the state back through
     * getSelectedRowNumbers() - the single source of truth - turns that into an immediate failure.
     *
     * WHY DESELECTION CAN BE A NO-OP: deselection only exists where an explicit selector is
     * rendered. On a single-select table whose only path is the row body, clicking a selected row
     * leaves it selected - the widget offers no deselection. A deselect request there must neither

     * selected (the selection was silently dropped by a toolbar re-render), or a row from an
     * earlier button is still selected and the new one is added on top. Both are the same
     * problem seen from different sides: no caller owned the *whole* selection state. This
     * method does, and it takes a row list rather than a single row so actions requiring
     * several input rows are covered by the same code path.
     *
     * Why the deselect loop is driven by getSelectedRowNumbers():
     * Iterating 1..getLoadedRowCount() and probing each row was not only N times slower, it
     * also silently skipped selected rows whose number fell outside the counted range - the
     * exact case that left two rows selected in tables with fixed columns.
     *
     * WHY THE MISMATCH IS RECONCILED INSTEAD OF REPORTED: the read-back used to run once and fail
     * the step as soon as it saw an extra row. But "one row too many is selected" is a state this
     * method already knows how to repair - it is exactly the work the deselect loop does. UI5
     * applies a selection change asynchronously and re-renders the table toolbar while doing so, so
     * a row deselected a moment earlier can reappear between the last click and the read-back.
     * Repairing and re-reading turns that into a pass, while a selection the widget genuinely
     * refuses to produce (e.g. a single-select table asked for two rows) still fails after the last
     * attempt, with the observed state in the message.

     *
     * WHY: header filters can only narrow the initial result. If that result is already empty,
     * every filter search returns an empty table as well, and verifyTableContent() fails with
     * "No loaded rows available for table content verification" - a gap in the test data, not a
     * broken filter. Reporting the filter phase as SKIPPED keeps it visible without a false red.
     *
     * WHY ONLY THE "always" AUTOLOAD STRATEGY IS JUDGED: only a table that loads on first render
     * shows its real initial result at this point. With "never" the table is empty by design until
     * the first search, and with "if_visible" it may not have loaded yet - hasAutoloadData() returns
     * true for that lazy strategy too, so it cannot make this decision. For those tables an empty
     * state says nothing about the data, so no precondition is judged and every filter search loads
     * the data itself, exactly as before. Skipping them would stop testing filters that work.
     *
     * WHY THE WAIT: counting while the initial load is still in flight would see an empty table
     * and wrongly skip every filter of the widget.
     *
     * getLoadedRowCount() is overridden by specialised nodes (e.g. the DataSpreadSheet renderer
     * API), so they inherit a correct count here without their own implementation.

     * Refines the generic, model-only matching of the parent (see
     * UI5DataNode::findColumnWithAttribute) using the actually rendered table headers.
     *
     * The parent returns the FIRST column whose attribute matches the filter attribute - either
     * exactly, or via the LABEL/relation-path heuristic (endsWith). When several columns can match
     * the same filter attribute - e.g. a foreign-key column plus the related LABEL column, or two
     * columns showing the same relation under different captions - that first match can be a column
     * that is not rendered as a header in the DOM, even though a matching, rendered column exists.
     * The caption of the non-rendered column is then handed to verifyTableContent(), which fails
     * with "Column '...' not found in table" although the filter itself worked. This is exactly the
     * "the code thinks it found the column, but the column is not actually in the table" problem.
     *
     * This override collects every model candidate and returns the best one, preferring in order:
     *   1. an exact attribute match whose caption is actually rendered as a header,
     *   2. a fuzzy (LABEL/relation) match whose caption is rendered,
     *   3. an exact match (even if not rendered),
     *   4. a fuzzy match (even if not rendered).
     * So the returned column is the one the content verification can locate whenever such a column
     * exists, while the previous behaviour is preserved as the fallback when nothing is rendered.
