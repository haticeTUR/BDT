     * WHY SCREENS IS A KIND BUT DIALOGS IS NOT: validating an entire page or dialog is a different
     * piece of work from exercising the filters or the buttons inside it, and it is recorded against
     * the screen itself rather than against any widget in it. A dialog, by contrast, is not a kind of
     * work at all - it is one of the things a button press can lead to, alongside navigation, an
     * inline action or a menu. What a press led to belongs in the substep title, not in the category.

     * WHY THERE IS NO PAGE-WIDE SEARCH HERE, UNLIKE IN THE REGULAR BUTTON LOOKUP: a button can only be
     * reached through the overflow of the widget it belongs to, and that widget is always known - every
     * step that clicks a button either works on a focused widget or names its table explicitly, and the

     * not carry this method at all - so the fallback is structurally unreachable rather than merely
     * discouraged.
     *

     * one is the top-most. Earlier matches can be leftovers of dialogs that are being closed.
