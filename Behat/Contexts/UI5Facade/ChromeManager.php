/**
 * Manages the lifecycle of a Chrome instance used for UI testing.
 *
 * Starts a dedicated Chrome process at the beginning of a test exercise and
 * stops it afterwards. Each instance listens on its own remote-debugging port,
 * which allows multiple projects to run their tests in parallel on the same
 * server without interfering with each other.
 *
 * Configuration is read from the chrome section of DatabaseFormatterExtension
 * in behat.yml / BaseConfig.yml:
 *
 *   axenox\BDT\Behat\DatabaseFormatter\DatabaseFormatterExtension:
 *     chrome:
 *       executable: 'data\...\GoogleChromePortable.exe'
 *       user_data_dir: 'data\...\ChromeUserData'
 *       port: 9222
 *
 * Each project overrides these values in its own behat.yml so that multiple
 * projects can run their tests simultaneously on the same server without
 * interfering with each other.
 *
 * Note: The remote-debugging port is configured separately in MinkExtension
 * (as part of the api_url) and in this config (as "port"). Both must match.
 * They are kept separate because MinkExtension parameters are not yet available
 * in the Symfony DI container when DatabaseFormatterExtension is loaded.
 *
 * Usage (singleton lifecycle):
 *
 *   // 1. DatabaseFormatter initializes the instance once, injecting the logger:
 *   ChromeManager::getInstance($workbench->getLogger())->start($chromeConfig);
 *
 *   // 2. All other callers retrieve the same instance without arguments:
 *   ChromeManager::getInstance()->stop();
 *   ChromeManager::getInstance()->restart();

     * Sends a GET request to a Chrome DevTools Protocol HTTP endpoint and returns the decoded JSON body.
     *
     * A new Guzzle client is created per call because Chrome's CDP endpoints are only
     * queried occasionally (startup polling, health probes, tab diagnostics) and do not warrant a
     * persistent HTTP client. Guzzle exceptions are caught, logged, and swallowed so
     * that callers such as waitUntilReady() can simply retry on the next iteration.
     *
     * WHY EXPLICIT TIMEOUTS: Guzzle's default request timeout is UNLIMITED. A Chrome that binds
     * the port but never answers - exactly the wedged state we are trying to detect - would make
     * this call block forever, and the caller's own timeout loop (waitUntilReady) would never get
     * to re-evaluate its wall-clock condition. The whole "give up after N seconds" contract of
     * every caller therefore depends on the two timeouts below being set here.
     *
     * WHY THE CEILING IS A PARAMETER: isAlive() deliberately probes with two different ceilings - a
     * short one on the hot path and a longer one when confirming a negative before a browser is killed.
     * Passing the ceiling in keeps both of them on this single, correctly-bounded HTTP path instead of
     * forcing a second client to exist for the slower probe.
     *
     * @param string     $url            Full URL of the CDP endpoint (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:9222/json/list)
     * @param float|null $timeoutSeconds Wall-clock ceiling; defaults to the hot-path probe ceiling
     * @return array Decoded JSON response body, or an empty array on any error
